# Advent of Code (2023) Solutions

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge that takes place during the month of December. It consists of a series of daily coding puzzles, where participants are tasked with solving problems using their programming skills. Each day, a new puzzle is released, and participants have to come up with solutions to solve the puzzle.

## My solution style

I tried to keep things simple and avoid using external libraries for my solution (with the exception of node's file API). I used [Quokka.js](https://quokkajs.com/) to test my solutions.
